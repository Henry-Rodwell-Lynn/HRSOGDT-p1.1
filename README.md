# HRSOGDT-p1.1 üóØÔ∏è

### My first outcome from HRSOGDT, where I aim to make 1 design tool from scratch every week. 

### This tool (aims) to allow users to create and export trails around simple .svg files. 

*I am totally open to comments and advice as to how I could potentially imporve this application. My aim is to learn and be honest as possible about being an amature creative coder.*
